# Connecting the shared rules to your project

Installing the chat and installing the hooks are separate. Hooks are commands
the CLI runs when it starts or receives a question. They read the shared
wiki's tools and hand the CLI the rules and documents that fit the project.

## 1. Prepare the wiki

First, sign in to the CLIs you need with your own account, following the
[chat install guide](chat-setup.md). If you do not need the chat screen,
preparing `python -m pip install -r <wiki path>/requirements-hooks.txt` in a
Python 3.11 or later environment is enough. The `python` in the commands below
has to be the interpreter those packages are installed into. The packages the
hooks use are listed in that one file, and `setup_agents` confirms them before
installing.

The wiki uses a clean git checkout at a stable path. The folder name is free.
Paths with spaces and Korean characters are supported, but the current
installer refuses a path containing a quote, a dollar, a backtick or a
newline. On Windows, Claude hooks need Git for Windows' Git Bash and Codex
hooks need PowerShell.

## 2. Configure the project

Create `.wiki/adapter.toml` in the target project and replace the example
below with that project's real check commands. `adapters/example.toml` is a
fictional example used by the checks, not a real project's settings.

```toml
agents = ["claude", "codex"]

[slots]
review_dir = "artifacts/review"
gate_cmd = "python -m pytest"
live_cmd = "confirm the real events in a new session"
server_stop = "Ctrl+C in the terminal that started it"
scratch_dirs = "artifacts/"
```

Run `git rev-parse HEAD` in the wiki folder and store the resulting
40-character value as a single line in the **target project's**
`.wiki/wiki-revision`. Use UTF-8 without BOM and LF. That value is how the
team confirms everyone is on the same tool version.

Connecting Codex needs the following in the target project's
`.codex/config.toml`. If the file exists, do not overwrite it — review and add
just this entry.

```toml
[features]
hooks = true
```

Whether a project can be trusted is the user's judgement, confirmed through
the CLI's trust settings and `/hooks`. The installer does not decide trust or
hook approval on your behalf.

## 3. Install and reinstall

Run these from the shared wiki folder. The paths are examples; point them at
the real target project.

```powershell
python tool/setup_agents.py --project "../example-project" --agent both
python tool/setup_agents.py --project "../example-project" --agent both --check
```

Using one CLI only, choose `--agent claude` or `--agent codex`. The CLI you
use has to be findable on that terminal's PATH. Settings are read from that
checkout directly and never copied into the hub. A reinstall preserves
settings created by other tools and the settings of any other host already
installed.

Having moved the project or the wiki, install again with the same command.
Raising the wiki version means reviewing the changes, replacing
`.wiki/wiki-revision` with the new value, and reinstalling.
`--allow-dirty-wiki` is for development checks and does not substitute for
verifying a released version.

## 4. Confirm on the real host

A successful `--check` is a settings-wiring check. That is different from the
automatic events actually succeeding. Open a new Claude Code session and a new
Codex session, and confirm the following.

- That the project documents and current state are delivered at session start
- That a question about a rule delivers that rule
- That the permissions and block rules needed for editing and checking behave
  as intended
- That the options question tool is actually offered on this host, in this mode

`trajectory.jsonl` is a trace of the injector running. A manual invocation or
a display-time query can create it too, so that file alone is not treated as
having verified the host's automatic events. If the question tool is not
offered, or is refused, record that result as it is.

A project's `.wiki` will accumulate real decisions and analysis records over
time. Separate what the team shares from personal records and set that
project's git exclusions accordingly.
